            <br></br>
I've been a Realtor now for 9 years, and perhaps more important is I have lived in the Smithville Mo and Platte City Mo area for over 25 years and am eager to help you accomplish your Real Estate goals.
<br></br><br></br>
As an avid fisherman and lake visitor I can also answer many questions you may have about Smithville Lake.
<br></br><br></br>
I have many skills at my disposal, and our brokerage has many people and tools to help you buy or sell a property right here in Smithville, Mo! Or the entire state of Missouri for that matter.

<br></br>
<br></br>
Buying a property?? After just a short conversation or email exchange I can set-up a search, guided by your criteria, that will automatically email you properties as they become available.
